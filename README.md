# UDP-Chat-Application 
  - This project enables real-time chat communication between a Server (Alex) and a Client (Gaitonde). Messages sent from the Server or Client are displayed on both interfaces, simulating a chat application similar to WhatsApp.

Compile the Java Files :
-
1. Run the Server
2. Run the Client
3. Send text :

    - From Server (Alex): Type a message in the Server's message box and click the "Send" button. The message will be displayed in both the Server and Client chat windows.
    - From Client (Gaitonde): Similarly, type a message in the Client's message box and click the "Send" button. The message will be displayed in both chat windows.
  
Output :
  - Server Terminal:
    
    - Displays a waiting message: `Waiting for client!`
    - After the client connects, displays: `Client is connected!`
      
  - Client Terminal:
  
    - Upon connecting to the server, displays: `Client is connected!`
  - Chat Frames:
    
      - Messages sent from either the Server or Client will appear in both chat frames, simulating a real-time chat interface.
